# **SySeBa – Syncro Service Backup**
![SySeBa Logo](https://github.com/okno/SySeBa/blob/main/SySeBa_Logo.webp)

*A lightweight, Anti Ransomware, Real‑Time, File‑Sync & Backup daemon for Linux*

## ✨ Overview
**SySeBa** is a Python-based daemon that provides real-time replication of a designated source directory to a backup target, while preserving deleted files in a structured restore path instead of removing them. 

It is designed as a lightweight, agentless Continuous Data Protection (CDP) solution optimized for Linux environments.

In the current threat landscape — where ransomware, insider threats, and unauthorized file manipulation are rising sharply — maintaining a secure, tamper-resilient backup workflow is no longer optional. 

Traditional periodic backups leave critical time gaps where data can be lost or encrypted without fallback. 

SySeBa addresses this by offering:
- Immediate file-level replication, reducing Recovery Point Objective (RPO) to near-zero;
- Soft-deletion safeguards, enabling forensic traceability and easy rollback from human or malicious deletions;
- SQLite-based audit logging and real-time disk usage monitoring to improve situational awareness.
  
By integrating seamlessly with systemd and operating without requiring external agents or network exposure, SySeBa helps enforce data resilience policies even in air-gapped or hardened environments.

## ❓ FAQ
<details>
<summary><strong>What if two instances start?</strong></summary>

A lock file at `/opt/syseba/syseba.lock` prevents duplicates; the second process exits.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where do deleted files go?</strong></summary>

They are **moved**, not removed, to the `restore` directory preserving structure & timestamps.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I replace SQLite?</strong></summary>

Yes – extend `initialize_database()` and `log_to_database()` for your preferred DB engine.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I restore a file?</strong></summary>

Manually copy/move it from `restore` back to `source`; SySeBa will sync it on the next cycle.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is it resource‑hungry?</strong></summary>

Average CPU usage is **< 1 %**, with spikes only during the first bulk sync.
